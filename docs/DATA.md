# Data Storage and Flow Prompt

This is an AI prompt for implementing data management in a spaced repetition flashcard application. Use this as guidance for creating robust data handling with dual storage strategies.

## Data Architecture Mission

Create a seamless learning experience that works both offline (guest users) and online (authenticated users) with intelligent data synchronization and optimistic updates.

## Essential Data Examples

### Basic Flashcard Structure

```json
{
  "id": "nihao",
  "front": { "icon": "üó£Ô∏è", "title": "‰Ω†Â•Ω", "description": "n«ê h«éo" },
  "back": { "icon": "üëã", "title": "Hello", "description": "A greeting used when meeting someone" },
  "learningData": {
    "easinessFactor": 2.5,
    "nextReviewDate": "2025-09-20",
    "totalReviews": 3,
    "isNew": false
  }
}
```

### Session Progress Tracking

```json
{
  "currentSession": {
    "totalCards": 8,
    "reviewedCards": 3,
    "easyCount": 1,
    "hardCount": 1,
    "againCount": 1,
    "isComplete": false
  }
}
```

### User Statistics

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "totalCards": 50,
    "dueCards": 8,
    "masteredCards": 12,
    "reviewsToday": 15
  }
}
```

## Storage Strategy Requirements

### Local Storage (Guest Users)

**Purpose**: Allow immediate app usage without registration

**Implementation Requirements**:

- Use localStorage with specific keys for data persistence
- Store flashcard data with learning progress
- Handle browser storage limitations gracefully
- Provide data export options for account migration

**Storage Keys to Implement**:

- `app-flashcards`: Complete flashcard data with learning progress
- `app-session`: Current review session state
- `app-stats`: Basic performance statistics

### Cloud Storage (Authenticated Users)

**Purpose**: Cross-device synchronization and data backup

**Implementation Requirements**:

- Secure user data isolation
- Efficient querying for due cards
- Optimistic updates with offline support
- Automatic data backup and recovery

## Data Flow Patterns

### Core Application Flow

```text
App Start ‚Üí Detect User Type ‚Üí Load Appropriate Storage ‚Üí Initialize Learning State
```

### Review Session Flow

```text
Start Session ‚Üí Load Due Cards ‚Üí Present Card ‚Üí Rate Quality ‚Üí 
Update Learning Data ‚Üí Save Progress ‚Üí Next Card ‚Üí Complete Session
```

### Data Synchronization Strategy

**Optimistic Updates**:

- Update UI immediately on user action
- Save changes to storage asynchronously
- Handle failures with graceful error recovery
- Provide visual feedback for sync status

**Offline Support**:

- Cache data locally for offline access
- Queue changes when connection unavailable
- Sync queued changes when online
- Resolve conflicts intelligently

## Guest-to-Authenticated Migration

**Migration Strategy**: Seamlessly transfer guest progress when users create accounts

**Implementation Guidelines**:

- Detect guest data in localStorage on account creation
- Validate and transform local data for cloud storage
- Batch upload to prevent data loss
- Clear local storage after successful migration
- Provide progress feedback during migration

## Error Handling Strategy

**Graceful Degradation**: Ensure app functionality regardless of storage issues

**Error Recovery Patterns**:

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Rollback UI changes on storage failures
- Offline mode fallback when cloud unavailable
- User-friendly error messages with recovery actions

## Performance Considerations

**Efficient Data Management**:

- Lazy load cards not currently needed
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Batch operations to reduce storage calls
- Optimize query patterns for due cards

**Memory Optimization**:

- Clean up unused data structures
- Implement efficient sorting for large datasets
- Use appropriate data structures for different operations

## Implementation Guidelines

**Data Consistency**: Maintain data integrity across storage types

**Privacy & Security**: Implement proper data isolation and validation

**User Experience**: Provide visual feedback for all data operations

**Scalability**: Design for growth in user base and data volume
